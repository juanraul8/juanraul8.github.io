The project goal is creating a sandbox to experiment with physically-based rendering algorithms based on the ray tracing system. The sandbox consists of predefined environments with scenes including assets such as: 
geometry, materials, light sources and textures. The implementation is based on the [Vulkan pipeline](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/) and it has been tested on a Geforce GTX 1060 and GeForce RTX 2070. More details about
the foundations can be found in the amazing [PBR book](http://www.pbr-book.org/3ed-2018/contents.html).
